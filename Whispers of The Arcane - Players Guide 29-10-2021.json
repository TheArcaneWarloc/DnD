The worship of the Red Knight is filled with doctrine about strategy, such as: \"Every war is a series of battles. Losing one doesn't mean losing the war.\" \"In war, plan for peace. In peace, plan for war.\" \"Seek allies among your enemy's enemies.\"",
						"Worship of The Red Knight arose among a hero-venerating monastic order of Bahamut in somewhere shortly after the Crown Wars; a War waged by multiple Elven kingdoms resulting in the destruction of at least 3 of them. The Red Knight has since grown in popularity because of what her followers call the Great Stratagem: for decades, her priests have been traveling to places of warfare to educate generals and kings in the arts of strategy and battlefield tactics. Many of the leaders they approached turned them away at first, but it soon became apparent that those who accepted the counsel of the Crimson General's followers gained a distinct benefit. Grateful victors built temples to the Lady of Strategy, and gradually her faith spread.",
						"Today, followers of the Red Knight can be found in nearly any land that has seen warfare in the past century. Worshipers of the Red Knight are rare in the general population, but those who revere her can frequently be found among high-ranking commanders of armies, instructors in colleges of war, quartermasters, and the authors of tomes of strategy. Each temple to the Red Knight includes an altar dedicated to Bahamut, and so such a place is likely to be frequented by mercenaries and soldiers. A temple is surrounded by a vast pavilion and courtyard, which can be rented by companies of soldiers and mercenaries for practice and training. Her priests believe that drilling one's troops in a temple courtyard is a form of propitiation that the Red Knight looks upon with special favor.",

				"The Chroniclers is among the oldest groups of Ilúvë, dedicated to recovering ancient accounts, as well as recording current events, which they call the 'Old Ways' or 'Elder Way'. Originally established as a group of inquisitive scribes and scholars, the Chroniclers have since been branded as conspirators and have gone into hiding. It is said they make their home on the Isle of Mystar, a strange magical island near the Gnomish Archipelago of The Isles.",
				"Even though the Chronicles are thus extremely reclusive, members of the Order can usually be recognized by their distinctive clothing, from which they get the nickname 'grey cloaks' (though apparently, their garments are now of a pale yellow color). The Chroniclers are governed by a body known as the Council of Artaeum. The Council is led by a single scholar who can hold various titles, including Ritemaster and Loremaster.",
				"It is widely know that The Red Tower, and, by proxy, The Unsorcerors, were created as a catalyst of the Chroniclers' disappearance, and had begun to develop in 2E 230, started by the right hand of the then-Loremaster, Archivist Dendur Bran.",
				"The Chroniclers, to most unknown, also created a small off-shoot of their order, the \"Hand of Eon's Minute\". This order has, since the Chroniclers have gone into hiding, reinstated itself in Thalor Ancalen, near the Cloakwood Forest. The monks of this monastic order teach a modified \"Elder Way\", wherein they believe and teach that Ki energy is the vital way to unlocking the secrets of time.",

Arconic used the Draconic alphabet in its written form, while the spoken language had many similarities with Sylvan, due to the Arcanixian mages being almost wholly comprised of Eladrin and High-Elves. A character who speaks Sylvan can understand what a creature speaking Arconic is saying, and vice versa. A character who has the {@background Cloistered Scholar|PHB} or {@background Sage|PHB} background, or a {@class warlock} who knows the {@optfeature Eyes of the Rune Keeper} invocation, can translate written Arconic without an ability check."
